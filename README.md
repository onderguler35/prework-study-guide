# <Prework Study Guide Homepage>

## Description
Web development bootcamp is a serious and long term commitment where the students need to study really hard to learn and practise the best they can. So it would be a good idea to use the most important topics of the prework course and gather them in a webpage helps the students greatly, to find the information they are looking for quickly. Most important points of the prework course at their fingerprints. This website will also help me to repeat what I have learned.
The coding phase of this web page by its own was a great experience to learn the basic concepts of the web development. I learnt some really exciting coding stuff which I am looking forward to improve and learn much more advanced functions. 

This project I made in the beginning of my programming learning journey will be a very interesting memory to look at in the future when I am much more ahead of where I am now. 

## Usage
You can see list of topics that we have studied during the prework and information about them. 
But the most important thing is that you should run the console from the browser, so you see the active js stuff going on which is the fun part.
